                  <p>Learning is a continuous process and the true learner always looks avenues to learn from anybody
                        and everybody. There is no age bar for learning. One learns about things through experience.
                        People learn from their success, failure, achievement and disappointment in life. Learning is
                        possible at every stage of life. SOMEWHERE I heard this phrase once, Life is a teacher, and we
                        are its students. </p>

                  <p>This is a time when many of us around the world are reflecting on how we can have the most positive
                        impact. I am reminded of my favorite saying about technology: "We always overestimate what we
                        can do in two years, and we underestimate what we can do in ten years." We may not have the
                        power to create the world we want immediately, but we can all start working on the long term
                        today. <span id="facebook">In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do
                              is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community
                              that works for all of us</span>.</p>

                        <p>Unlike Rajshahi, Rangpur and a few other cities in North Bengal, Bangladesh recently
                              increased cool. The present intensity of winter make of north bengle people harmful and
                              day by day go Unbearable. This year, however, the winter reappeared with vengeance.
                              Mercury dropped to around 6 degrees Celsius on some days in late December in Dinajpur.So
                              the people here need help. If possible I can help them with something. </p>
